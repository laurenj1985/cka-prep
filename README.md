# cka-prep

I'm using this repo in order to help document my process preparing for the Kubernetes CKA exam. I have already used Kubernetes to help some clients build solutions for their companies, but I have a goal of getting stronger with the technology. Although I am practicing creating the resources with both imperative and declarative methods, I am primarily saving the yaml files that I create here.

To practice on my machine I am primarily using a Kind cluster, but I use a Minikube cluster with some tasks as well.
